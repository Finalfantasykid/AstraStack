<h1>About</h1>
<p>The purpose of AstraStack is to have a simple to use application to stack videos/image sequences.  Stacking is a technique used to improve the quality of the image by aligning each frame and then averaging the frames to create a low noise version of the image which can then be sharpened.</p>

<p>I had always been looking for a stacking application which would run natively on Linux.  RegiStax would sort of run using wine, but it was quite glitchy, and hadn't been updated in years.  AutoStakkert is supposed to run well in wine, but ideally I wanted to be able to run it natively.  Not to mention none of those options are open source, so I resorted to creating my own.</p>

<p>AstraStack itself runs on Windows and Linux and is open source.  It should also run on MacOS with minimal modifications, but I don't have access to a MacOS system at the moment so am unable to test it.

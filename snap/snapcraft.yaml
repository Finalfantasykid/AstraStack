description: |
  AstraStack is an easy to use application used to stack videos or images 
  of planets, the sun, moon, deep sky objects and more. Stacking is a 
  technique used to improve the quality of the image by aligning each frame 
  and then averaging the best frames to create a low noise version of the 
  image which can then be sharpened.
